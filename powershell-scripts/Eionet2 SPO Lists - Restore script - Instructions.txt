Notes
=====================================================
- First time you have to execute the script as a tenant admin and a local Windows admin (it is required in order to install properly the PnP module and to register the module permissions in Azure).
- The first script command will download and install the PnP module on your system, if it is not already installed. Next time this will be automatically skipped (the script checks if the module PnP module is already installed).
- The next script command is used to grant access in Azure for the PnP module functions. It will open a visual prompt with the user permissions to be granted. Next time this will be automatically skipped (if the PnP module is detected is already installed).
Please make sure you grant/confirm the access rights requested in the window.
- The SPO lists will be restored from the backup .xml files. If a list with the same name already exists in the SPO site, you will be asked to remove it first through a confirmation prompt. If you choose No, that list restore will be skipped.
- The script will restore only the lists for which it finds in the execution folder the backup .xml files.
- The script will report which lists were restored and which ones were not.
